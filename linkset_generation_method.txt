Generation of Mesh Block Match Linkset Method
=============================================

The G-NAF May 2016 dataset was the product that was chosen for its Addresses to generate the Mesh Block Match linkset to
the ASGS's 2016 Mesh Blocks, in line with the 2016 Australian census (2016-08-09). Since the G-NAF May 2016 dataset was
a few months before the census date, it did not have the Mesh Blocks to form this linkset. To create this linkset, the
Mesh Blocks from the G-NAF August 2016 dataset have been back-ported to the G-NAF May 2016 dataset.


Method
------

The G-NAF May [1] and August [2] 2016 datasets were ingested into a PostGreSQL data store. The address_mesh_block_2016
table from the August dataset was then ingested into the May version (as it does not contain the Mesh Block Match data).
The Mesh Block Match data from the August dataset was dumped to CSV for each corresponding Address in the May dataset.


Findings
--------

Initially, only address_mesh_block_2016 rows with an Address created on or before the census date was ingested into the
May version. It was quickly found that some Addresses from May to August had been modified, including its date_created
column. This meant that many of the Mesh Block Match with Addresses which should exist before the census date have now
been filtered out because their date_created were changed to after the census date.

(a) By filtering it out based on the Address' date_created in the August version:
    1. 40,508 Addresses in May version did not have a corresponding Mesh Block Match
    2. 111,703 Mesh Block Match did not have a corresponding May Address
    3. 40,508 Addresses were supposedly created after census date (even though the persistent ID for these newly created
       Addresses existed in the May version)

(b) With no filtering on the Addresses of the Mesh Block Match in August:
    1. 38,913 Addresses did not have a corresponding Mesh Block Match
    2. 111,706 Mesh Block Match did not have a corresponding Address

(c) The total number of Mesh Block Match:
    1. 14,247,235 in the August version
    2. 14,245,637 with Addresses created before the census date
    3. Difference of the two is: 1598


Insight
-------

In (a) 40,508 Addresses were supposedly created after the census date. However, subtracting (b1) from (a1), the result
was 1595. This means that 1595 Addresses with the same persistent ID had their date_created property changed from its
original value to after the census date. Another interesting finding was the result of subtracting (a2) from (b2) was
a difference of 3. This may be a coincidence but the difference of (c3) and the result of (a1) minus (b1) was also 3.
This showed that the Addresses and Mesh Block Match for at least the 1595 Addresses with altered date_created property
had a 1:1 relationship.
